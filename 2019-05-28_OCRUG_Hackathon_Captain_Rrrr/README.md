## Abstract

- Investigated the relationship between population size and water depletion
- Found a sharper gradient (faster groundwater depletion) in agricultural vs. urban counties
- Orange County showed an opposite relationship to nearby large urban counties that could not be explained
- Water levels are highly correlated with drought severity
- Built a decision tree model to predict whether water level in 2019 is higher/lower compared to 2014
