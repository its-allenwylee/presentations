## Abstract

In my presentation, I plan to give a brief overview of various regression models: their settings, mathematical expressions, and implementation to datasets with complete R codes. The following models will be considered: linear (normal response), gamma (right-skewed response), logistic (binary response), Poisson, zero-truncated Poisson, zero-inflated Poisson, longitudinal model, and hierarchical model.
