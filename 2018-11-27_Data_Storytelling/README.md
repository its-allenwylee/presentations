##Title: Telling Meaningful Stories with Data 

###Abstract
According to Edward Tufte, an excellent data visualization expresses â€š complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision and efficiency. Visualization is a dynamic form of persuasion, telling a story through the graphical depiction of statistical information. Few forms of communication are as persuasive as a compelling narrative. So how does a data scientist tell a meaningful story with a visualization? The analysis has to find the story that the data supports, and journalists have become very good at storytelling with visualization via infographics. In that vein, this presentation will share how some journalistic strategies on telling a good story can be applied to data visualization.
