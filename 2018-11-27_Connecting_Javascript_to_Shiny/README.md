## Abstract
The parts of Shiny that run in the browser are implemented in Javascript, and Shiny can be extended and enhanced in interesting ways by connecting Shiny to custom Javascript or Javascript libraries. Shiny supports 3 means of Javascript integration: custom inputs, custom outputs, and htmlwidgets. Of these, htmlwidgets are the most general and powerful, as they can work offline and embedded in RMarkdown. In this talk I'll give an overview of Shiny's relationship to Javascript, show how new htmlwidgets can be built using the React.js framework and integrated with Shiny, and share resources for doing front-end web development in a Shiny context.
