# It’s not that we don’t test our code, it’s that we don’t store our tests

## Abstract:
Software testing is important and we all do it. However, it is often not done in a principled way. It is standard practice in the software development community but is less common in analytics. testthat is a testing framework for R that is similar to other unit testing systems that you may know. It seamlessly integrates into the package development workflow so that you can test early and often.

testthat decreases code development and maintenance frustration. Unit testing will help you develop better code structure by making your code easier to test. Thus, lazy development becomes better development. It allows you to quickly debug issues by isolating the source of a bug faster so that you can get back to the ‘real’ coding. It also allows you to have confidence that your changes did not break existing code.

We will go over some basic unit testing concepts, how to set up testthat and write tests.
