##Title: R Programming in a Regulated Environment


###Abstract
Like most other programming departments operating in the biotech/pharmaceutical industry, Amgen Global Statistical Programming (GSP) primarily uses SAS to analyze and report data for clinical trials. Indeed, SAS is a well-established commercial software product that is the de facto standard in clinical trial environments. In recent years however, R has surged in popularity and has evolved to become a worthy programming language along with SAS. At Amgen, a group of programmers was assigned to investigate and establish R as a programming language within GSP. This group – the R Consultancy Group – has addressed package validation, reproducibility and other challenges. We are now beginning to implement R for the following:

1) ggplot2 to create publishing-ready figures needed for Clinical Study Reports
2) plotly to create dynamic graphs for department-level initiatives
3) Shiny for data checks and product-level safety reporting
4) R Markdown for a source code library for figures
5) packrat for reproducibility

I will present an overview of our technical progress in these areas.
