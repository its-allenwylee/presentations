## Abstract

- Modelled the proportion of residents in fair/poor health in a county based on the contaminant levels and standard demographic controls
- Investigated both ordinary least squares regression and generalized additive models
- Arsenic appears to have a nonlinear effect not picked up by ordinary least squares
- Started to look at how contaminants affect birth rates
- Found a general decline in health (across multiple measures) in California since 2010
