## Abstract:
Google released TensorFlow software in 2015 targeted for the Deep Learning applications. Two primary misconceptions about TensorFlow are as follows. First, it can only be used with Python and second, it can only be used for building deep learning applications

This talk will demystify these concepts. First, TensorFlow can also be used with R and any programming language. Second, TensorFlowâ€™s main objective is to solve the mathematical problem (including differential equations) which contains multi-dimensional arrays (or tensors). Deep Learning Neural Networks is just another application of TensorFlow.

In this first part, the fundamental architecture of TensorFlow will be covered. TensorFlow works on the concept of DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). First, a DAG of the mathematical problem is built, and then the DAG is executed in the most efficient way using CPU, GPU or TPUs. The interface between R and TensorFlow will be discussed by building Neural Networks using R and TensorFlow.
