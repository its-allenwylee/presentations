##Title: Amazon Alexa Skill Store

###Abstract
Using effectively the skill intent model (a description of a third party application), including but not limited to, description, sample utterances, keywords, maturity rating, etc. we try to classify Alexa skills into one of 20 categories. Creating features with text data has a two-fold approach. The first is to use frequency of words to give words to each word occurring in the skill-intent model and use this matrix to predict the category as a supervised classification problem. The second is to use the semantic meaning, that is similarity of words, defined by cosine similarity. To overcome the big challenge of overlapping categories, we use a probabilistic approach to categorization.
