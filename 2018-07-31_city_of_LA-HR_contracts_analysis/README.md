## Abstract
Our team project is to help determine the true benefits costs in Human Resource contracts and we were working with IBM and the City of Los Angeles for our capstone. We used IBM Watson software (mainly Knowledge Studio and Natural Language Understanding) to conduct an analysis and our target data was the MOUs published on the City of LA website. Throughout the five-month project, we were given timetables in which we were to essentially learn the City MOUs breakdown and understand the MOUs. From the City’s part, questions/possibilities were brought up as in, what are the common and unique benefits for each MOU? Can Watson help identify more irrelevant information in City contracts, so they can be amended? Can we use the potential model to compare other City employment contracts/MOUs to their own? And lastly, how will the changes of benefit costs bring to social issues such as crime rate? Through creating dictionaries, applying pre-annotators, doing human annotating, training and evaluating the models, we achieved an overall model F1 score of 0.8. For detailed statistics, we got 0.5 in recall for ‘benefits’ and 0.26 for ‘eligibility’. Recalls for other entities are as high as above 0.7. We helped the City of LA in saving contract processing time and the model was able to analyze contract (average 19,000 words) within 10mins.
