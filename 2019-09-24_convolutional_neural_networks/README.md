## Abstract

A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of deep neural networks used primarily for analyzing visual imagery. CNNs are used for object recognition in an image. Autonomous cars use CNN technology to navigate smoothly on the roads. There are many biomedical applications where CNN is used for image analysis.

The motivation for CNN originated from the Hubel & Wiesel (Noble prize winners 1981) study of the human visual system. This research leads to the idea that if we apply the convolution operations to the image and then feed them to neural networks, the accuracy of object identification increases. This idea started the revolution of CNN.

This talk will cover the architecture of CNN. The Convolution and Pooling operations will be covered. Tools for building a CNN are R and TensorFlow. The implementation of CNN in R will be demonstrated.
