##Title: Tibbles, and list columns, and nested data frames, oh my!

###Abstract
Tibbles are a "modern reimagining of the data.frame" and are a big part of the tidyverse, but what are they really, how are they different from standard data frames, any why should you care about using them? In this talk, I'll dive into tibbles and show how they can be used in several interesting ways taking advantage of list columns and nested data frames. Regardless of what you use R for, learning to harness the power of the tibble is an essential part of doing effective data analysis in the tidyverse.
