##Title: Pacific Life's Deferred Annuity

###Abstract
Our most essential task in this project is to review the mortality experience from Pacific Life. In particular, we are looking into the mortality from Pacific Life's Deferred Annuity block of business. A Deferred Annuity is a retirement investment vehicle and functions like a mutual fund if managed efficiently. Pacific Life is internally required to use their current model to run periodic projections for the purposes of hedging, pricing and various other activities. Our goal is to identify and analyze the policy attributes that led to the disparity from the model and improve the model according to the results of the analysis and potentially provide business intelligence regarding mortality that can support marketing and operational strategies.
