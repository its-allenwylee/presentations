## Abstract

Topic models allow us to access the contribution of each topic and its
representations across different documents. Human genomes have been
exposed to an assortment of mutational processes by contributing to
unique patterns of somatic mutations. What would happen if we apply
the same concept to the somatic mutations obtained from the cancer
patients and look for “topics” of mutations? I will introduce a simple
example of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and its application in
investigating cancer patients' mutational profiles in addition to
available Bayesian tools in R to conduct statistical inference.
